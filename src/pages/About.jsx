        Hello! My name is Annson, and I’m a software developer with a passion
        for coding and over 6 years of experience in the IT field. Although I’m
        relatively new to coding, I’ve always been interested in technology
        since I was little and have spent many years working with various
        software applications and systems, hardware, and networks. My experience
        includes working with SQL, RESTful APIs, building networks from the
        ground up, Agile software development, and much more.

        be part of an industry that’s constantly evolving and pushing the
        boundaries of what’s possible. Over the past few months, I’ve been
        working hard to develop my skills and build a solid foundation in
        programming languages like Python and React.js.
